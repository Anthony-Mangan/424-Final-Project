To use this Fantasy Football Start-Sit Decider, open up the 424FinalProject.sln file. This should include four .h files: PlayerStats.h, Players.h, ComparePlayers.h and Rankings.h. From there, go to the .cpp file
and run the program. The command window will prompt you to pick 2 players and their respective team matchup. The code will calculate the expected average for the player based on their matchups and previous 
performances and output the player it recommends that you start.
